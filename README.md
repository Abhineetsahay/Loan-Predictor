# 🏦 Loan Predictor

This is a machine learning project to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant details.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

- Implements both **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier** for prediction  
- Performs basic data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handles imbalanced data  
- Compares model performance using accuracy and classification reports  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Output Example

Both models achieve around **75-76% accuracy** on the test data.  
Performance may vary slightly depending on preprocessing and feature selection.
